# DC Universe ClickyGame

## General Overview

This homework assignment created a memory game using React. The assignment required the appication's UI to be broken up into different UI components (which managed the component state, and responded to the users events).

## Instructions

Test your memory with your favorite DC Universe characters.

Click on each character exactly once to win the game. But don't click on a character twice, or it's game over for you! Once you get to 12 you win, but don't worry if you don't make to 12 because the "Top Score" section in the top corner will track your best attempt so you know the number that you have to beat the next time around.
